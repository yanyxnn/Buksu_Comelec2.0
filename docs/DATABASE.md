**# BUKSU COMELEC 2.0 — DATABASE ARCHITECTURE**

Status: **\*\*APPROVED — Phase 1A domain model baseline\*\***  

Implementation status:
- **Phase 01A** — architecture approved.
- **Phase 01B** — migration implementation complete; database integrity hardening implemented.
- **Phase 01B verification** — canonical local MariaDB 10.4.32 integrity verification: **76 passed / 0 failed**.
- **Phase 01C** — database integrity testing is the active phase. Phase 01C design is approved; **implementation has not yet started**.

This document is the approved database architecture baseline derived from the completed Phase 1A domain model review. It defines the intended MySQL domain structure, relationships, integrity boundaries, immutability rules, ballot-secrecy boundary, and migration order.

Laravel migrations are the executable schema source of truth (established in Phase 01B). If an implementation detail differs from this document, the discrepancy must be reviewed rather than silently changing the architecture.

\---

## Implementation status

This section records the current repository state. The approved architecture remains the baseline, while implementation and verification progress are recorded explicitly so the documentation does not confuse design approval with implementation or verification.

### Phase 01A

Approved architecture and domain-model baseline.

### Phase 01B

The approved database schema has been implemented through Laravel migrations and database-integrity hardening.

Verified schema characteristics include:

- 23 guarded ENUM columns.
- Each guarded ENUM column has a corresponding named CHECK constraint.
- `election_incidents.severity` is intentionally nullable `VARCHAR(255)` and is not ENUM/CHECK constrained.
- `ballots.status` is `CAST` only.
- `ballot_dispositions.disposition` includes `VOIDED`, `EXCLUDED_FROM_CALCULATION`, and `REINSTATED`.

Phase 01B integrity verification evidence:

- Canonical local MariaDB 10.4.32 verification: **76 passed / 0 failed**.
- The Phase 01B verification remains the baseline regression gate for the database schema.

### Phase 01C

Database integrity, concurrency, security, and reconciliation testing is in progress.

The Phase 01C design and transaction/security decisions are approved. A substantial portion of the Phase 01C verification harness has now been implemented and exercised.

Verified so far:

- Phase 01C baseline: **23 passed / 0 failed**.
- Extended Phase 01C suite: **56 passed / 0 failed**.
- Reconciliation oracles: **11 passed / 0 failed**.
- Phase 01B regression verification was re-confirmed during the Phase 01C verification sequence.
- The full Phase 01C verification sequence was executed twice with identical results.
- Concurrency cases include duplicate-submission races, forced deadlock behavior, blocking close/vote behavior, and stale-read canary behavior.
- Database-role security checks include real MariaDB privilege enforcement.
- Reconciliation testing includes clean fixtures and deliberately seeded corruption cases.

The expanded Phase 01C verification work was exercised on MariaDB 10.11.14 in the verification environment.

**Important:** MariaDB 10.4.32 remains a required Phase 01C completion gate for the expanded Phase 01C suite. The 10.11.14 results are verification evidence but do not replace the required MariaDB 10.4.32 gate.

The approved Phase 01C D3 identifier correction has been implemented:

- Domain A participation/submission identifiers remain ULID-based.
- Domain B ballot-secrecy-sensitive identifiers use UUIDv4 where approved.
- The correction is documented in the change history and related database/security documentation.

Phase 01C remains **IN PROGRESS** until all required security, regression, concurrency, reconciliation, MariaDB-version, and sign-off gates are satisfied.

\---

**## 1. Core database principles**

1\. **\*\*MySQL is authoritative.\*\*** Election facts required to reconstruct participation, ballots, and results must be committed to MySQL.

2\. **\*\*InnoDB is required.\*\*** Transactions and foreign-key integrity are foundational to vote submission.

3\. **\*\*Election rules are data-driven.\*\*** Contest types, seats, selection limits, eligibility rules, scopes, and reporting dimensions must not be hard-coded into table structure or election-specific controllers.

4\. **\*\*Participation and ballot content are separated.\*\*** No normal database path connects a ballot to a student.

5\. **\*\*Cast ballots are immutable evidence.\*\*** Normal administration cannot edit, delete, replace, or reset a cast ballot.

6\. **\*\*Snapshots are frozen before voting.\*\*** Configuration, eligibility, candidate roster, and ballot structure are locked before \`OPEN\`.

7\. **\*\*Finalized elections are immutable.\*\*** Post-finalization issues are handled through incident/disposition records, not by mutating finalized election data.

8\. **\*\*Critical integrity uses the simplest strong mechanism:\*\*** database constraints first, transactional application enforcement second, reconciliation third, and triggers only if a future demonstrated requirement justifies them.

\---

**## 2. Domain A — voter identity and participation**

**### \`students\`**

Permanent student identity and current official master-data projection.

Key fields:

\- \`institutional_id\` — unique permanent student identity.

\- \`institutional_email\` — write-protected through ordinary editing.

\- \`first_name\`, \`middle_name\`, \`last_name\` / official name fields.

\- \`current_college\`, \`current_course\`, \`current_year_level\`.

\- \`status\` — \`ACTIVE\` or \`INACTIVE\` only; no \`IRREGULAR\` status.

\- \`google_subject\` — nullable until first institutional Google login; unique when present.

\- \`last_import_batch_id\` — FK to \`import_batches\`.

**### \`student_enrollments\`**

Append-only history of the official academic placement reported by each Data Center import.

Key fields:

\- \`student_id\` FK.

\- \`import_batch_id\` FK.

\- \`college\`, \`course\`, \`year_level\`, \`status\`.

\- \`effective_from\`.

Constraint:

\- \`UNIQUE(import_batch_id, student_id)\`.

Each row is the placement reported for a student by one official Data Center import. An import may contain at most one placement record per student. Duplicate student IDs within the same uploaded file are handled through \`import_batch_rows\` (classified \`DUPLICATE_IN_FILE\`) and do not become multiple enrollment rows. The same student may have enrollment rows across different import batches; those rows preserve historical placement. The uniqueness constraint also protects chunked-import retry/idempotency, so a retried chunk cannot insert the same placement twice.

The course-change rule is applied when the new course placement is recorded: a student entering a new course becomes \`1st Year\` in that new course. Year level is not derived from individual subjects.

**### \`admin_users\`**

### `admin_users`

Pre-authorized COMELEC IT administrator accounts.

Administrator accounts are established as part of system/operational setup and exist independently of the official Data Center student import. Administrator records are not created, discovered, converted, or deleted through student Data Center imports.

Administrators do not publicly register or create their own administrator accounts.

Key fields:

* `authorized_email` — pre-authorized personal Google email for this administrator. This authorization exists before first login and is unique among admin records.
* `google_subject` — nullable before the administrator's first successful Google login; when populated, contains the administrator's stable Google `sub` and is unique.
* `display_name`.
* `role = BUKSU_COMELEC_IT_ADMIN`.

Authentication lifecycle:

1. The administrator record exists before the administrator's first login.
2. The administrator does not register through the public application.
3. On first Google login, Google must provide a verified email.
4. The verified Google email is normalized and matched to the existing `authorized_email`.
5. If the match succeeds and `google_subject` is still `NULL`, the stable Google `sub` is bound to that existing administrator record.
6. Subsequent administrator authentication uses the bound stable Google `sub`.
7. A failed or unauthorized Google login never creates an administrator record.
8. An existing non-NULL `google_subject` is not replaced by a different Google `sub` merely because an email matches.

The initial/current roster of three authorized administrators is an operational control. The number three must not be implemented as a permanent database cardinality constraint or permanent application maximum.

**### \`import_batches\`**

Audit/history for official Data Center imports.

Key fields:

\- \`source_filename\`, \`academic_year\`, \`semester\`.

\- \`uploaded_by\` FK \`admin_users\`.

\- \`status\`: \`STAGED\`, \`VALIDATING\`, \`PREVIEWED\`, \`CONFIRMED\`, \`PROCESSING\`, \`COMPLETED\`, \`FAILED\`.

\- received/created/updated/error counts.

\- source-file \`checksum\`.

\- \`started_at\`, \`confirmed_at\`, \`completed_at\`.

**### \`import_batch_rows\`**

Thin staging/classification layer for validation preview and review.

Key fields:

\- \`import_batch_id\` FK.

\- \`institutional_id\` from the source row.

\- \`classification\`: \`NEW\`, \`UPDATED\`, \`DUPLICATE_IN_FILE\`, \`INVALID\`, \`NEEDS_EXCEPTION_REVIEW\`.

\- \`raw_row_json\`.

\- \`resolved_student_id\` nullable FK.

\---

**## 3. Domain B — election configuration and snapshots**

**### \`elections\`**

Election event and lifecycle root.

Key fields:

\- \`name\`.

\- \`type\` as a descriptive/configuration label, not a code branch.

\- \`state\` — configured lifecycle from the approved election state machine.

\- \`current_config_version_id\`.

\- \`locked_config_version_id\`.

\- \`timezone\` — default \`Asia/Manila\` unless explicitly configured.

\- \`opens_at\`, \`closes_at\`.

\- \`created_by\`, \`approved_by\` FKs to \`admin_users\`.

**### \`election_config_versions\`**

Versioned normalized configuration plus frozen serialized snapshot.

Key fields:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`version_number\`.

\- \`status\` — \`DRAFT\`, \`APPROVED\`, \`SNAPSHOTTED\`, \`SUPERSEDED\`.

\- \`config_json\` — frozen artifact generated from normalized configuration when snapshotted.

\- \`proposed_by\`, \`approved_by\` FKs to \`admin_users\`.

**\*\*Source of truth rule:\*\*** while editable, normalized configuration tables are authoritative. At snapshot time, \`config_json\` is generated as a read-only reproducibility artifact. It is not a second editable source of truth.

**### \`representation_groups\`**

Reusable grouping of contests around configured dimensions such as college/year. The exact table-vs-columns implementation choice is deferred to Phase 1B migration design, provided it preserves configuration-driven behavior.

**### \`contests\`**

Election contest/position definition.

Key fields:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`election_config_version_id\` FK.

\- \`name\`, \`position_label\`.

\- \`scope\`.

\- \`representation_group_id\` nullable FK.

**### \`contest_rules\`**

Contest-specific voting rules.

Key fields:

\- \`contest_id\` FK.

\- \`seat_count\`.

\- \`selection_limit\`.

\- \`allow_abstain\`.

\- \`voting_method\` (\`SINGLE_CHOICE\` / \`MULTI_CHOICE\` or the approved normalized representation).

Important behavior:

\- A multi-seat contest may allow a voter to select fewer than the configured maximum.

\- Fewer than the maximum selections is still \`VOTE\`.

\- Explicit abstention is a separate response.

**### \`contest_eligibility_rules\`**

Rule definition for which eligible voters may participate in the contest.

Key fields:

\- \`contest_id\` FK.

\- \`rule_definition_json\`.

**### \`candidate_roster_snapshots\`**

Versioned frozen candidate roster.

Key fields:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`election_config_version_id\` FK.

\- \`version_number\`.

\- \`status\`: \`DRAFT\` / \`LOCKED\`.

\- \`locked_at\`.

**### \`ballot_structure_snapshots\`**

Frozen definition of what voters actually receive.

Key fields:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`election_config_version_id\` FK.

\- \`candidate_roster_snapshot_id\` FK.

\- \`eligibility_snapshot_id\` FK.

\- \`version_number\`.

\- \`status\`: \`DRAFT\` / \`LOCKED\`.

\- \`locked_at\`.

\- \`structure_json\` — frozen description of contests/rules/candidates presented.

\---

**## 4. Domain C — candidates and candidacies**

**### \`candidates\`**

Thin permanent candidate identity anchor.

Key field:

\- \`student_id\` FK, unique.

No election-specific profile fields belong here.

**### \`candidacies\`**

Election-specific candidacy.

Key fields:

\- \`candidate_id\` FK.

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`contest_id\` FK.

\- \`party_id\` nullable FK.

\- candidate display/profile fields (\`display_name\`, \`photo_path\`, \`bio\`).

\- \`status\` lifecycle including \`DRAFT\`, \`FOR_REVIEW\`, \`VERIFIED\`, \`APPROVED\`, \`PUBLISHED\`, \`LOCKED\`, with \`WITHDRAWN\` / \`DISQUALIFIED\` as applicable.

\- \`roster_snapshot_id\` FK nullable until locked.

**### \`parties\`**

Election-scoped party/group configuration by current approved design.

A future institutional decision that parties must be persistent/accredited across elections would require revisiting this model.

\---

**## 5. Domain D — eligibility snapshots**

**### \`election_eligibility_snapshots\`**

Frozen eligibility computation for an election.

Key fields:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`election_config_version_id\` FK.

\- \`status\`: \`DRAFT\` / \`LOCKED\`.

\- \`rule_definition_json\`.

**### \`election_eligible_voters\`**

Materialized locked voter set used by the election, not a live query against current student master data.

Key fields:

\- \`eligibility_snapshot_id\` FK.

\- \`student_id\` FK.

\- frozen \`college\`, \`course\`, \`year_level\`, \`status\`, \`sector\` where applicable.

\- \`source\`.

\- \`is_exception\` and \`exception_reference\`.

After the snapshot is locked, later Data Center imports do not silently change active-election eligibility.

\---

**## 6. Domain E — voting and ballot secrecy**

**### \`submission_attempts\`**

Idempotency/request tracking.

Key fields:

\- \`submission_uuid\` — unique, opaque, client-generated.

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`student_id\` FK.

\- \`status\`: \`RECEIVED\`, \`VALIDATING\`, \`COMMITTED\`, \`FAILED\`, \`REJECTED\`.

\- \`failure_reason\` coarse-grained only.

\- \`committed_at\`.

**### \`voter_participations\`**

Records that a student successfully participated.

Key fields:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`student_id\` FK.

\- unique \`(election_id, student_id)\`.

\- \`submission_uuid\` (same business submission reference used by the participation record).

\- \`participated_at\`.

\- opaque \`receipt_code\`.

\- \`is_full_election_abstention\`.

This table is Domain A and may reference the student.

**### \`ballots\`**

Anonymous cast ballot.

Required properties:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`ballot_structure_snapshot_id\` FK.

\- current opaque ULID/ballot identifier. The approved Phase 01C D3 correction will change this identifier to UUIDv4 before Phase 01C implementation is finalized (see Section 14).

\- \`cast_at\`.

\- row-level \`status = CAST\` for normal operation.

The table MUST NOT contain:

\- \`student_id\`.

\- \`institutional_id\`.

\- \`voter_participation_id\`.

\- \`submission_uuid\`.

\- \`receipt_code\`.

\- Google identity/subject.

\- Any equivalent voter identifier.

**### \`ballot_contest_responses\`**

Exactly one explicit response per contest on a committed ballot.

Fields:

\- \`ballot_id\` FK.

\- \`contest_id\` FK.

\- \`response_type\` = \`VOTE\` or \`ABSTAIN\`.

\- unique \`(ballot_id, contest_id)\`.

There is no domain \`SKIP\` state.

Identifier note: \`ballot_contest_responses.id\` is currently a ULID (Phase 01B); the approved Phase 01C D3 correction will change it to UUIDv4 (see Section 14).

**### \`ballot_candidate_selections\`**

Candidate selections under a \`VOTE\` contest response.

Fields:

\- \`ballot_contest_response_id\` FK.

\- denormalized \`contest_id\` used for composite candidate-membership FK.

\- \`candidacy_id\` FK.

\- unique \`(ballot_contest_response_id, candidacy_id)\`.

\- composite FK \`(candidacy_id, contest_id)\` to a unique \`(id, contest_id)\` on \`candidacies\`.

\`ABSTAIN\` means zero selection rows. The database FK does not itself enforce zero children for \`ABSTAIN\`; the atomic voting transaction enforces the rule and reconciliation detects anomalies.

**### \`ballot_reporting_contexts\`**

One immutable non-identifying reporting context per ballot.

Fields:

\- \`ballot_id\` FK, unique.

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- frozen college/course/year/sector values where applicable.

It is copied by value from the locked eligibility snapshot at cast time.

It MUST NOT contain a student identifier or a key back to an eligibility-voter row.

**### \`ballot_events\`**

Ballot lifecycle/traceability event history.

Fields:

\- \`ballot_id\` FK.

\- event type.

\- related incident/result-run IDs where applicable.

\- \`actor_id\` may reference \`admin_users\` for investigation actions.

\- notes and timestamp.

It must remain inside the ballot correlation domain and must not contain voter identity fields.

Identifier note: \`ballot_events.id\` is currently a ULID (Phase 01B); the approved Phase 01C D3 correction will change it to UUIDv4 (see Section 14).

**### \`ballot_dispositions\`**

Append-only exceptional handling for a ballot.

Possible dispositions include:

\- \`EXCLUDED_FROM_CALCULATION\`.

\- \`VOIDED\`.

\- \`REINSTATED\`.

Original ballot, response, and selection rows are never edited or deleted. Result calculation uses the applicable disposition when deciding whether a ballot contributes to a calculation.

The exact disposition-to-result-run semantics are an implementation-phase decision and must preserve historical reproducibility.

Identifier note: \`ballot_dispositions.id\` is currently a ULID (Phase 01B); the approved Phase 01C D3 correction will change it to UUIDv4 (see Section 14).

**### \`outbox_events\`**

Transactional outbox for post-commit side effects such as aggregate realtime updates and notifications.

The outbox contains aggregate-level payloads only and never selection-level voter-linked content.

\---

**## 7. Ballot secrecy and traceability boundary**

The database intentionally contains two non-overlapping correlation domains.

**### Domain A — voter identity**

\`students\`, \`voter_participations\`, and \`submission_attempts\` may reference student identity.

**### Domain B — anonymous ballot lifecycle**

\`ballots\`, \`ballot_contest_responses\`, \`ballot_candidate_selections\`, \`ballot_reporting_contexts\`, \`ballot_events\`, and \`ballot_dispositions\` must not contain voter identity.

There must be no persistent join key between these domains — not a foreign key, not a shared UUID, not a hash, and not a reused correlation identifier.

The correspondence exists only transiently while the atomic vote transaction is being processed.

This provides **\*\*anonymous-but-traceable ballots\*\***:

\> COMELEC can investigate what happened to ballot X without the normal database providing a lookup from ballot X to the student who cast it.

Server/application logging must follow the same boundary and must not introduce a shared identifier that recreates the link.

\---

**## 8. Abstention and participation semantics**

**### Non-participation**

A student never opens/submits the election:

\- no \`voter_participations\` row.

\- no \`ballots\` row.

**### Complete election abstention**

A student deliberately abstains from the entire election:

\- one \`voter_participations\` row.

\- one \`ballots\` row.

\- one \`ABSTAIN\` response for every applicable contest.

\- zero candidate-selection rows.

**### Contest-level abstention**

For each contest independently:

\- \`VOTE\` → one or more candidate selections, subject to configured limits.

\- \`ABSTAIN\` → zero candidate selections.

Selecting fewer candidates than a multi-seat maximum is still \`VOTE\`, not abstention.

\---

**## 9. Results architecture**

**### \`result_calculation_runs\`**

Records a calculation execution:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- algorithm version.

\- ballot count at run.

\- status.

\- started/completed timestamps.

\- result digest/checksum.

**### \`result_aggregates\`**

Configurable aggregate model.

Fields:

\- \`result_calculation_run_id\` FK.

\- \`contest_id\` nullable.

\- \`candidacy_id\` nullable.

\- \`metric_type\` — e.g. \`CANDIDATE_VOTE_COUNT\`, \`CONTEST_ABSTAIN_COUNT\`, \`CONTEST_PARTICIPATION_COUNT\`, \`OVERALL_CAST_COUNT\`, \`OVERALL_PARTICIPATION_COUNT\`.

\- \`dimension_type\` — \`OVERALL\`, \`COLLEGE\`, \`COURSE\`, \`YEAR_LEVEL\`, \`SECTOR\`.

\- \`dimension_value\` nullable for \`OVERALL\`.

\- \`count\`.

\- \`denominator_type\` and \`denominator_value\` where applicable.

Unique slice:

\`(result_calculation_run_id, contest_id, candidacy_id, metric_type, dimension_type, dimension_value)\`.

**### \`result_snapshots\`**

Frozen official result record.

Fields:

\- \`election_id\` FK.

\- \`result_calculation_run_id\` FK.

\- \`status\`: \`PENDING_VALIDATION\`, \`VALIDATED\`, \`OFFICIALLY_ANNOUNCED\`, \`FINALIZED\`.

\- \`snapshot_json\` containing the complete detailed result set and stored denominator values.

At finalization, this becomes the durable official record and is not edited.

**### Result sources**

Overall results:

\`ballots → ballot_contest_responses → ballot_candidate_selections\`.

Detailed results:

\`ballots → ballot_reporting_contexts → responses/selections\`.

Participation:

\`election_eligible_voters ↔ voter_participations\`.

No result calculation reconnects a ballot to a student.

**### Percentages**

Every percentage must carry an explicit denominator.

Supported denominator concepts include:

\- election-eligible voters.

\- contest-eligible voters.

\- contest participants (\`VOTE + ABSTAIN\`).

\- contest voters who chose \`VOTE\`.

The default reporting choice for contest abstention and candidate vote percentages remains an institutional/reporting-policy decision.

For multi-seat contests, candidate totals and candidate percentages may collectively exceed 100% because one voter may select multiple candidates.

\---

**## 10. Audit, incident, and operational tables**

**### \`audit_logs\`**

General operational activity history.

Must not contain candidate selections, passwords, tokens, session IDs, or unnecessary sensitive data.

**### \`election_incidents\`**

Investigation and incident record.

**### \`incident_events\`**

Append-only events within an incident.

Ballot-specific lifecycle belongs to \`ballot_events\`/\`ballot_dispositions\`, not to a general audit record that might accidentally introduce voter/ballot correlation.

\---

**## 11. Snapshot dependency order**

1\. Election configuration version.

2\. Eligibility snapshot and candidate roster snapshot.

3\. Ballot structure snapshot.

4\. Election enters the locked/open lifecycle.

The ballot structure snapshot references the final configuration, candidate roster, and eligibility snapshot.

\---

**## 12. Migration dependency order**

1\. \`admin_users\`, \`students\`

2\. \`student_enrollments\`, \`elections\`, \`import_batches\`

3\. \`import_batch_rows\`, \`election_config_versions\`

4\. \`representation_groups\`, \`parties\`, \`candidates\`

5\. \`contests\`

6\. \`contest_rules\`, \`contest_eligibility_rules\`

7\. \`election_eligibility_snapshots\`

8\. \`election_eligible_voters\`, \`candidate_roster_snapshots\`

9\. \`candidacies\`

10\. \`ballot_structure_snapshots\`

11\. \`submission_attempts\`, \`voter_participations\`

12\. \`ballots\`

13\. \`ballot_contest_responses\`

14\. \`ballot_candidate_selections\`

15\. \`ballot_reporting_contexts\`, \`outbox_events\`

16\. \`result_calculation_runs\`

17\. \`result_aggregates\`, \`result_snapshots\`

18\. \`election_incidents\`, \`audit_logs\`

19\. \`incident_events\`, \`ballot_events\`, \`ballot_dispositions\`

20\. Backup/health metadata — deferred until RPO/RTO and tooling decisions are finalized.

There must never be a migration wave that creates a foreign key from voter participation to ballot.

\---

**## 13. MySQL integrity strategy**

**### Database-enforced**

\- unique \`(election_id, student_id)\` on \`voter_participations\`.

\- unique \`submission_uuid\`.

\- unique \`(ballot_id, contest_id)\` on contest responses.

\- unique candidate selection per response/candidate.

\- candidate-membership composite FK.

\- necessary foreign keys for parent/child integrity.

**### Transactionally enforced**

\- election/contest state.

\- selection count limits.

\- \`VOTE\` requires at least one selection where required.

\- \`ABSTAIN\` requires zero selections.

\- exact completeness of contest responses.

\- snapshot compatibility checks.

**### Detective reconciliation**

\- unexpected ballot/participation count mismatches.

\- impossible \`ABSTAIN\` + selection combinations.

\- invalid selection counts.

\- missing reporting context.

\- malformed/incomplete ballot structures.

\- inconsistent result aggregates.

No MySQL triggers are required by the current Phase 1A design, and none are used at this stage.

**### Phase 01B implementation details**

- 23 ENUM columns have corresponding named CHECK constraints.
- CHECK names follow `chk_<table>_<column>`.
- ENUM and CHECK member sets are intended to remain identical.
- Invalid domain values are tested for rejection and non-persistence.
- `election_incidents.severity` remains free-form nullable `VARCHAR(255)`.
- `VOIDED` is accepted as a `ballot_dispositions.disposition` value and rejected as a `ballots.status` value.
- Ballot secrecy structural checks include absence of direct voter-identity columns in Domain B and absence of persistent foreign keys between the identity/participation and ballot domains.

\---

**## 14. Identifier strategy**

**### Original Phase 01A approved strategy**

Use ULIDs for privacy-relevant or externally referenced identifiers such as:

\- ballots.

\- ballot contest responses.

\- ballot events.

\- ballot dispositions.

\- submission attempts.

\- voter participations.

Use auto-increment identifiers where opacity has no security value and internal query/index performance is more important, such as configuration/reference rows and high-volume child selection rows where they are never externally exposed.

**### Current implemented Phase 01B state**

- `voter_participations.id` and `submission_attempts.id` remain ULIDs.
- `ballots.id`, `ballot_contest_responses.id`, `ballot_events.id`, and `ballot_dispositions.id` are currently ULIDs.
- Internal auto-increment IDs remain where already designed.

**### APPROVED PHASE 01C D3 CORRECTION — NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

Change `ballots.id`, `ballot_contest_responses.id`, `ballot_events.id`, and `ballot_dispositions.id` from time-ordered ULIDs to UUIDv4.

`voter_participations.id` and `submission_attempts.id` remain ULIDs.

Rationale: reduce temporal/ordinal correlation risk between Domain A participation records and Domain B ballot records.

Until implemented, the repository schema still uses ULIDs for all six identifiers.

\---

**## 15. Implementation boundaries**

This document does not itself authorize:

\- models.

\- controllers.

\- services.

\- policies.

\- UI.

\- realtime implementation.

\- package installation.

\- institutional policy invention.

Phase 01B has already converted this approved architecture into Laravel migrations.

Phase 01C includes the approved D3 identifier correction and will verify MySQL integrity, idempotency, concurrency, immutability, and secrecy-boundary behavior.

\---

**## 16. Remaining decisions intentionally not fixed by this schema**

\- exact contest list and seat counts for each election.

\- sector definitions and sector voter eligibility.

\- reporting percentage default denominator policy.

\- small-group reporting suppression threshold.

\- persistent institutional party registry, if ever required.

\- exact Google Workspace account-linking policy.

\- RPO/RTO and backup tooling/retention.

\- capacity targets and load thresholds.

\- exact change-request workflow implementation (generic mechanism implemented in Phase 02, see below; real action types remain open).

\- exact ballot-disposition scoping if future incidents require per-result-run treatment.

## Phase 02 additions

* `change_requests` (bigint PK): `action_type`, `subject_type/id`, `payload_json`, `status` enum PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED, `requested_by` and `decided_by` FK `admin_users` (RESTRICT), `decided_at`, `decision_note`. MySQL/MariaDB CHECKs: status set; decided rows carry decider+time and pending rows do not; `decided_by <> requested_by`. SQLite cannot add these (same limitation as existing enum CHECKs); the decision UPDATE also carries the predicates.
* `notifications`: standard Laravel database-notification table (in-app approval notifications).
* `access_issue_reports` (Login / Access Reports): `problem_type` (student-chosen; plain string validated against `config('comelec.access_issue_problem_types')`, deliberately not a DB enum), `google_email` (verified institutional email), `reported_student_id` (as typed, unverified), `description`, `denial_reason` (SYSTEM-generated: why authentication denied the login; never student-supplied), `subject_fingerprint` (16-hex keyed hash), timestamps. No token/`sub` columns; no FK to `students`. Login / Access Reports (cannot authenticate) are distinct from the future General Reports (Phase 03, authenticated users), which are not part of Phase 02.
* Student login treats `students.last_import_batch_id IS NOT NULL` as "loaded by the official Data Center import". Student first-linking is by verified institutional email when `students.google_subject IS NULL`, followed by authentication using the stable Google `sub`.
* Administrator accounts are pre-authorized independently of the Data Center import. Admin records exist before first login, do not use student import data, and have no public registration path.
* `admin_users.authorized_email` is the pre-authorized administrator email used for the first-login identity match. `admin_users.google_subject` is nullable before first login and unique when populated.
* On first admin login, verified Google email is matched to the existing pre-authorized admin record and the stable Google `sub` is atomically bound to that record. An unauthorized Google login never creates an admin.
* `admin_users.role` CHECK = `BUKSU_COMELEC_IT_ADMIN` (MySQL/MariaDB only). The current three-admin roster is an operational control; it is not a schema-level permanent cardinality limit.
* `users` and `password_reset_tokens` dropped by a forward migration (reversible). `sessions` retained.
* Cross-table uniqueness of Google `sub` (admin vs student) is not expressible as a constraint without triggers; it is enforced at admin first-link, student first-link, and every subsequent login.
